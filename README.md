## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install Arduino IDE 2**  
   If not already installed, download and install it from the official [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Copy Libraries**  
   Place the contents of the `Libraries` folder into:  `C:\Users[YOUR_USERNAME]\Documents\Arduino\Libraries`

3. **Install Board Drivers**  
	Most clone boards use the CH341 USB-to-serial driver. Install it if needed.

4. **Open the Project**  
	Navigate to and open:   `Firmware\ProjectorFanController`

5. **Connect the Board**  
	- Select **Arduino Nano** as the board type.  
	- Some boards require `ATMega328p (Old Bootloader)`, others use `ATMega328p`.

6. **Compile and Upload**  
	Compile the sketch and upload it to the board via USB.

7. **Verify Operation**  
	- Open the **Serial Monitor** at **115200 baud**.  
	- You should see logs from all three temperature sensors.  
	- Sensors should show valid temperatures and respond to changes.

8. **Install in Projector**  
	- Attach the sensors to:
	  - the **lamp radiator**
	  - a **corner of the LCD**
	  - the **CPU**
	- Recommended adhesive: **silicone glue** for best thermal contact.
